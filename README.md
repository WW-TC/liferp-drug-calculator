# How does it work?
The calculator supports all 3 drugs, it also has 4 operating modes, here is how they works :

- Budget : You give the calculator your total budget, and it will calculate the maximum quantity of drugs you can produce with your budget.

- Profit : You give the calculator how much you want to make, and it will calculate how much drugs you have to produce in other to get there, it also accounts for material cost.

- Joints/Bags : You give the calculator the amount of Joints/Bags you want to produce, and it will tell you the full list of materials needed to produce said amount.

- Trays/Batches : With Crystal and Snow, you cannot produce bags individually, therefore you can use this mode to do the same calcul as the Joints/Bags mode, but using a full cycle.
